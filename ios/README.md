- CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager

### Getting Started

1. **Create Xcode Project**:
   ```bash
   # This will be done manually in Xcode
   # File -> New -> Project -> iOS -> App
   # Name: AI Audio KB
   # Bundle ID: com.prompted.ai-audio-kb
   # Language: Swift
   # Interface: SwiftUI
   ```

2. **Configure App Capabilities**:
   - Background App Refresh
   - Audio Recording
   - CallKit
   - Push Notifications
   - App Groups (for widget sharing)

3. **Add Required Permissions** (Info.plist):
   ```xml
   <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app requires microphone access to record audio for transcription</string>
   
   <key>NSPhoneCallsUsageDescription</key>
   <string>This app integrates with phone calls for recording capabilities</string>
   
   <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
   <array>
       <string>audio</string>
       <string>background-processing</string>
       <string>background-fetch</string>
   </array>
   ```

## üìä Architecture

### Core Components

   - Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
   - Real-time audio processing and buffering

2. **NetworkManager**
   - WebSocket streaming connection
   - Batch upload with retry logic
   - Adaptive bitrate management

3. **ConsentManager**
   - Regional policy enforcement
   - Consent hash generation
   - Privacy controls and audit logging

4. **StorageManager**
   - Core Data model for local storage
   - AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
   - Automatic cleanup and retention policies

5. **IntegrationsManager**
   - Siri Shortcuts registration
   - Widget data sharing
   - CallKit integration

## üîß Development Phases

### Phase 1: MVP (Weeks 1-2)
- [x] Project structure setup
- [ ] Basic audio capture with AVAudioEngine
- [ ] Voice Activity Detection implementation
- [ ] Local encrypted storage with Core Data
- [ ] Simple upload mechanism
- [ ] Basic consent management

### Phase 2: Pilot (Weeks 3-4)
- [ ] WebSocket streaming implementation
- [ ] CallKit integration for phone calls
- [ ] Siri Shortcuts support
- [ ] Control Center widget
- [ ] Network adaptation logic
- [ ] Battery optimization

### Phase 3: Production (Weeks 5-8)

- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] App Store optimization
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Security audit and hardening
- [ ] User onboarding flow

## üîí Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- All audio data encrypted at rest using iOS Keychain-derived keys
- Network transmission over TLS 1.3 with certificate pinning
- Automatic data expiration based on regional policies

### Privacy Compliance
- Dynamic consent collection based on user location
- Granular recording controls (per-app, per-contact, per-location)
- Complete audit trail for regulatory compliance
- Right-to-delete implementation

### Device Security
- Apple App Attest integration for device verification
- Jailbreak detection and response
- Secure enclave utilization where available
- Regular security key rotation
